# Coding-Quiz
Module 4 Challenge - Coding Quiz

In this challenge, I created a "Coding Quiz" around JavaScript fundamentals.
<ul>When I click the start button, then a timer starts and the first question is presented.</ul>
<ul>When a question is answered, then the user is presented with another question.</ul>
<ul>When a question is answered incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the timer.</ul>
<ul>When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.</ul>
<ul>When the game is over, then the user can save their initials and score to the leaderboard.</ul>
